# Phase 2 Implementation Notes

## Current Status
Starting Phase 2 implementation after successful completion of Phase 1.

## Phase 1 Achievements ✅
- Fixed input validation with NaN/infinite value detection
- Resolved circular import issues with lazy loading
- Fixed batch processing vmap axis specification
- Updated JAX compatibility (tree_map → tree.map)
- Fixed cache mechanism and pytree registration

## Phase 2 Goals
1. **Mathematical Accuracy**: Ensure approximate algorithm produces valid convex hulls
2. **Vertex Count Constraint**: Output vertices ≤ input vertices
3. **Improved Predicates**: More accurate volume, surface area, point containment
4. **Quality Metrics**: Implement hull quality assessment

## Implementation Plan
- Start with staged selection method design
- Implement multi-method volume computation
- Enhanced geometric predicates
- Comprehensive testing and validation

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Algorithm redesign started
- [ ] Tests for new implementation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Documentation updates
