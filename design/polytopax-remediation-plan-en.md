    """Improved differentiable convex hull algorithm"""
    
    # Stage 1: Coarse approximation to filter candidate points
    candidates = _coarse_hull_approximation(points)
    
    # Stage 2: Fine adjustment to approach actual convex hull vertices
    refined_hull = _refine_hull_vertices(candidates, points)
    
    # Stage 3: Limit output vertex count to input point count or less
    hull_vertices = _limit_vertex_count(refined_hull, points.shape[0])
    
    return hull_vertices

def _coarse_hull_approximation(points: Array) -> Array:
    """Coarse approximation candidate point selection"""
    # Initial selection using direction vectors
    # Preserve geometric constraints
    pass

def _refine_hull_vertices(candidates: Array, points: Array) -> Array:
    """Differentiable fine adjustment"""
    # Use soft selection while preserving geometric validity
    pass

def _limit_vertex_count(hull: Array, max_vertices: int) -> Array:
    """Vertex count limitation"""
    # Select most important max_vertices vertices
    pass
```

#### 2.2 Volume/Surface Area Computation Accuracy Improvement
```python
# Target fixes
- tests/test_predicates.py::TestConvexHullVolume::test_different_volume_methods

# Improvement plan
def convex_hull_volume(vertices: Array, method: str = "auto") -> float:
    """Multi-method volume computation"""
    methods = {
        "delaunay": _volume_delaunay_triangulation,
        "simplex": _volume_simplex_decomposition,
        "monte_carlo": _volume_monte_carlo_validation
    }
    
    if method == "auto":
        # Compute with multiple methods and check consistency
        results = {name: func(vertices) for name, func in methods.items()}
        return _consensus_volume(results)
    else:
        return methods[method](vertices)
```

#### 2.3 Point Containment Testing Improvement
```python
def point_in_convex_hull(point: Array, vertices: Array) -> bool:
    """Improved point containment testing"""
    # More accurate half-space intersection testing

    # Efficient implementation with fixed-size arrays
    pass
```

    """High-speed 2D Graham Scan"""
    # Angle-sorting based implementation

    pass
```
